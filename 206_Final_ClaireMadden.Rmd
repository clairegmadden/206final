```
The appropriate analysis for exploring the relationships between climate change perspectives, information exposure, education attainment, poverty levels and coastline on the proportion of people who believe that global warming is happening is to use a Multiple Linear Regression because exploratory analysis showed a linear trend between independent continuous variables and the proportion of respondents who think global warming is happening. 

```{r 1b, echo = FALSE}
#b. An exploratory correlation matrix for all continuous variables (make it readable, but it does not need to be finalized and you do not need to add a figure caption).

**Table X. Climate Change Opinions Regression Results.** Multiple linear regression results modeling the effect of information exposure, education attainment, poverty levels and coastline on the proportion of people who believe that global warming is happening. This model [proportion of people who believe global warming is happening = 0.36 (percentage with bachelors) + 0.34 (poverty rate) + 2.54 (state with coastline) + 0.64 (percentage who discuss)] explains a significant amount of the variance in climate change opinions [F(4,46) = 77.66, p <0.001, Adjusted R$^2$ = 0.86].
```{r 1c, results = 'asis', header = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
#c. A finalized table of results for your analyses (you may present more than one model), with a figure caption.

lm_table <- stargazer(climate_lm_4, 
          type = 'html', 
          digits = 2,
          style = "aer",
          dep.var.labels = c("Global Warming is Happening"),
          covariate.labels = c("Bachelors Degree",
                               "Poverty Rate",
                               "State with Coastline",
                               "Discuss with Friends/Family"))
  

```


```{r 1d, include = FALSE}
#d. Choose two coefficients in the model that you find interesting (either because they are expected or unexpected). For each, write a single sentence explaining what that coefficient means in terms of an expected change in the dependent variable.

```
<br>
It is interesting yet expected that, all else equal, the proportion of people who think global warming is happening increases by 2.5 among respondents who live in states with coastline when compared to those living in states without coastline.
<br>
<br>
An interesting and surprising coefficient is the effect of a Bachelors degree on the proportion of people who believe global warming is happening, which increases by only 0.36 for every one unit increase in the proportion of respondents with a Bachelors degree, if everything else is held constant. 

```{r, include=FALSE}
#e. Based on diagnostic plots, describe (1 - 2 sentences) if you have concerns about heteroscedasticity or normality of residuals for your model(s). You do not need to include the diagnostic plots in your final document.

plot(climate_lm_4)
# seems legit - well distributed no obvious issues with heteroscedasticity, normality of the qq is a little concerning on the tails, but most of the variances are right along the line


```
The model presented does not present significant concerns for homoscedasticity and the distribution of residual variances appears to be even. The assumption of normality presents a slight cause for concern, as the upper and lower tail of the residuals does not follow a pattern of normal distribution, however the majority of the residuals do appear to be normally distributed. 

###PART 2.

```{r 2, include=FALSE}
#Explore associations between race/ethnicity and perceived campus respect based on counts in ‘ucsb_climate.csv.’
```

```{r 2a, include=FALSE}

#a. In 1 - 2 sentences: What type of analysis will you perform? In the context of this task, what research question will your analysis answer?
# chi square
# is there a significant effect of race on perceived campus respect?
# H0: there is no effect

```
In order to determine if there is a significant effect of race on an individual's perception of campus respect at UCSB, a chi-square test is used to test if proportions of respondents between groups are significantly different. The research question this test will answer is "Does race have a significant effect on responses to the perception of overall campus climate at UCSB"?


```{r 2b, include = FALSE}
#b. A one sentence finalized statement of the statistical results for the analysis you decided on in (a). You are not expected to do post-hoc testing, but you can if you want to.


# make rownames race categories
ucsb_climate_chi <- ucsb_climate %>% 
  select(-race)

rownames(ucsb_climate_chi) <- c("African American/African/Black", "American Indian/Alaskan Native", "Asian/Asian American", "Hispanic/Latino", "Middle Eastern/South Asian/North African", "Pacific Islander", "White") 

# make a proportion table
prop_table <- prop.table(as.matrix(ucsb_climate_chi), 1)

prop_table

# run chisq to test for significant effect
chi_test <- chisq.test(ucsb_climate_chi)

chi_test
# there is a significant effect of race on percieved campus respect
# p < 0.001

```
Based on results from the UCSB Campus Climate Survey (2014), race identity of respondents has a significant effect on the perception of campus climate [$\chi^2$(`r chi_test$parameter`) = `r round(chi_test$statistic, 0)`,  p < 0.001.]



**Table X. Proportions of Student Responses to UCSB Campus Climate Survey by Race.** Proportion of responses by race to UCSB Campus Climate Survey question asking respondents to indicate their race identity and their perception of overall campus climate as either "Very Respectful", "Respectful", "Disrespectful", or "Very Disrespectful". Race identity has a significant effect on the perception of campus climate [$\chi^2$(`r chi_test$parameter`) = `r round(chi_test$statistic, 0)`,  p < 0.001].
<br>
```{r 2c, echo = FALSE}
#c. A finalized figure or table that clearly shows counts and/or proportions of respondents’ perceptions of campus respect for each race/ethnicity reporting. Include a caption.

# respect_table <- kable(ucsb_climate, col.names = c("Race", "Very Respectful", "Respectful", "Disrespectful", "Very Disrespectful"), align = "l") %>% 
 # kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped"), full_width = FALSE)


#respect_table 


respect_prop <- kable(round(prop_table,2), col.names = c("Very Respectful", "Respectful", "Disrespectful", "Very Disrespectful"), align = "l") %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped"), full_width = FALSE)

respect_prop
```


```{r 2d, include=FALSE}
#d. A concise 2 - 3 sentence discussion of interesting differences and/or similarities across groups, and notable big picture trends.

```
The results show that the majority of each race group would classifiy the campus environment at UCSB as respectful or very respectful, however there were larger proportions of respodents that felt the campus environment was either disrespectful or very disrespectful within the African American (10%), Hispanic (9%) and Middle Eastern (10%) groups. Additionally, for all race groups except White, a larger portion of respondents felt the campus was respectful compared to very respectful, while responses within White students were equal for both respectful and very respectful (49%). 

###PART 3. 
```{r 3, include=FALSE}
#explore effects of sex and age on probability that a person will respond True or False to the statement: “I am usually self-conscious.” Data in ‘tmas_df.csv’ are accessed and updated from openpsychometrics.org (a cool site for open-source survey data).
# true = 1
# false = 0
# sex_mf reference = female

binary_df <- tmas_df %>% 
  mutate(
    response = case_when(
      response == "True" ~ 1,
      response == "False" ~ 0
    )
  )
  
blr <- glm(response ~ age + sex_mf, family = "binomial", data = binary_df)
summary(blr)

# age significantly predicts response to "are you self conscious"
# a one year increase in age will result in a 0.03 decrease in the likelihood of a respondent answering true
```


**Table X. Effects of Sex and Age on Self Consciousness.** Binary linear regression modeling the effects of age and sex on a respondent's answer ("True" or "False") to the statement "I am usually self-conscious". The model shows that age has a significant effect on respondent's answers ($\beta$ = -0.033, p < 0.001, $\alpha$ = 0.05) while sex does not significantly effect the outcome ($\beta$ = -0.014, p = 0.863, $\alpha$ = 0.05). 
```{r 3a, results = 'asis', header = FALSE, echo = FALSE}

#a. A finalized table of model results and statistics. Include a table caption.

blr_table <- stargazer(blr, 
          type = 'html', 
          digits = 2,
          style = "aer",
          dep.var.labels = c("Self Conscious"),
          covariate.labels = c("Age",
                               "Sex"))

# reference level for sex is female

```



<br>
```{r 3b, echo = FALSE}
#b. A finalized graph showing predicted probabilities for True/False responses, separated by sex over a range of ages, with standard errors included. You do NOT need to include a figure caption.

seq_age <- rep(seq(from = 0, to = 100), 2) # Create a sequence from 0 to 100, twice (one will be "Male" and one will be "Female")

f_101 <- rep("Female", 101) # Repeat 'Female' 101 times
m_101 <- rep("Male", 101) # Repeat 'Male' 101 times
mf_101 <- c(f_101, m_101) # Combine them into a single vector

# Combine the age and sex sequences into a single data frame
tmas_newdata <- data.frame(seq_age, mf_101) # make column names match variables in the model!
colnames(tmas_newdata) <- c("age","sex_mf")

# predict probabilities for every age based on the model
predicted_probs <- predict(blr, newdata = tmas_newdata, type = "response", se.fit = TRUE)


# create a new data frame with predicited probabilities and standard errors
graph_data <- data.frame(tmas_newdata, predicted_probs$fit, predicted_probs$se.fit)

# rename columns
colnames(graph_data) <- c("Age", "Sex", "Probability", "SE")


# graph predicted probabilities with standard error ribbons
ggplot(graph_data, aes(x = Age, y = Probability))+
  facet_wrap(~Sex)+
  geom_line(aes(color = Sex), show.legend = FALSE)+
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = Probability - SE, ymax = Probability + SE, fill = Sex), show.legend = FALSE, alpha = 0.5)+
  theme_minimal()+
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0),
                     limits = c(0,1))+
  labs(y = "Probability (True)",
       x = "Age",
       title = "Predicted Probability by Age of Males and Females \nResponding True to the Statement: I Am Usually Self Conscious.")

```




```{r 3c, include = FALSE}
#c. In 2 - 3 sentences, describe trends/differences/similarities that are seen in the graph, and how those align with the results you report in (a).

# a clear trend among respondents of both sexes is a decline in the number of "true" responses to the question "Am I ususally self-conscious" as age incresed. 

# sex seems to have very little impact on response (nonsignificant pvalue from above) 


```

The graph shows a clear trend among both sexes that as age increases, the probability of a respondent answering "True" to the statement "I am usually self-conscious" decreases, an effect that was significant based on the binomal linear regression ($\beta$ = -0.033, p < 0.001, $\alpha$ = 0.05). Alternately, sex does not have a significant effect on respondent answers, as can be seen by the similar trend in predicted probabilities between males and females ($\beta$ = -0.014, p = 0.863, $\alpha$ = 0.05). 



###PART 4.
```{r 4, include = FALSE}
#Is there a significant difference in pyraclostrobin concentrations in strawberries (STRAWBERRY (ALL OR UNSPEC)) and carrots (CARROTS (ROOT CROP))? use PesticideResidues dataframe

```


```{r 4a, echo = FALSE}
#a. Summarize/describe any exploratory analyses that you performed in order to decide on the appropriate test to compare concentrations. Include exploratory graphs that informed your decision (you don’t need to finalize or include figure captions here). Based on those outcomes, justify your choice of test.


# simplify dataframe to include only the commodities and pesticide of interest
pesticide_simple <- pesticide_residues %>% 
  filter(commodity == "STRAWBERRY (ALL OR UNSPEC)" |
           commodity == "CARROTS (ROOT CROP)") %>% 
  filter(chemical_detected == "PYRACLOSTROBIN")

# explore the distribution of the data
exp_hist <- ggplot(pesticide_simple, aes(x = amount_detected))+
  geom_histogram(bins = 10)+
  facet_wrap(~commodity)


exp_hist
# doesn't look like a normal distribution
# carrots only have 15 observations
# strawberries have 40 observations


exp_qq <- ggplot(pesticide_simple, aes(sample = amount_detected))+
  geom_qq()+
  facet_wrap(~commodity)

exp_qq
# very much not normal looking
# will go with a Mann Whitney U test

```
<br>
Based on the data exploration above, the data does not seem to be normally distributed, and observations for one group (carrots) are below 30 so the Central Limit Theorem does not apply. Because of this, I will use a Mann Whitney U test to check for significant difference in median pesticide concentration between carrots and strawberries. 


```{r 4b, include = FALSE}
#b. In 1-2 sentences, state your final results in a format that would be suitable for publication in a professional report or article.

# separate carrots and strawberries into their own dataframes
carrots <- pesticide_simple %>% 
  filter(commodity == "CARROTS (ROOT CROP)")

strawberries <- pesticide_simple %>% 
  filter(commodity == "STRAWBERRY (ALL OR UNSPEC)")


# mann whitney u test
test <- wilcox.test(strawberries$amount_detected, carrots$amount_detected)

test

# there is a significant difference in median amount of pesticide detected between strawberries and carrots
# p < 0.001


# test for effect size
cliffs <- cliff.delta(strawberries$amount_detected, carrots$amount_detected)

cliffs

# cliff's delta = 0.695 (large)

```
Based on the data of pesticide residues from the California Department of Pesticide Regulation, there is a significant difference in median pesticide concentration detected between carrots and strawberries [W = `r test$statistic`, p < 0.001] and the effect size is large (cliff's delta = `r cliffs$estimate`).
